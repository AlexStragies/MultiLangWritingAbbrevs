* MultiLangWritingAbbrevs
Collection of scripts and datasources to create "abbrev" definitions in several languages to save on typing.

The main features are:
- Help with accent typing: In FR-Mode "element" becomes "élément"
- Avoid many Apostrophes: In EN-Mode "dont" becomes "don't", in FR-Mode "lecole" becomes "l'école"

- Don't remember the double consonants? "lacesoire" becomes "l'accessoire"

- skip (some) vowels: For FR "ag" become "âge", For EN "hvnt" could be "haven't"
- So many pesky spaces: "alecol" becomes "à l’école"
- ...

OK, the last one looks difficult to remember. It is, but you don't need to remember them, you just need to
 know the rules that were applied in generating them from a dictionary table following the grammatical rules.


For French many thousands of these were generated automatically, and I learn the correct spelling (mostly w.r.t. accents)
 for new words every day with this.


** English
This list was collated from fragments left and right.

** French
This list was mostly generated with some lost =awk= and =q= scripts from a language database table.
